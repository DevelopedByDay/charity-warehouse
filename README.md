# giVing
Web based charity donation site with multiple options to choose from, with the ability to set your favorites up as your own personal list. Motivation was to have a website, where we could browse through several different categories of charities, view their mission and websites and be able to donate to the ones you choose.

## User Stroy
As a user, I want an application that will show me several different charities from several different categories so that I can shop through them without having to look up the websites one by one.

## Functionality
GIVEN a charity clearing house site
WHEN I visit the site for the first time 
Then I am presented with a signup/login page
AND categories of charities to explore
WHEN I log into the website
THEN I can favorite charities to have on a quick list to reference later
